	<br>
	<p>
		I am an Assistant Professor of Mathematics (tenure track) at Swarthmore College in the Department of Mathematics & Statistics. My research focuses on developing efficient and robust algorithms for solving partial differential equations. My recent work focuses on studying low-rank tensor decompositions and their applications in plasma physics and transport problems.
	</p>
	<p>
		I currently serve on the editorial board of MAA FOCUS, the newsmagazine of the Mathematical Association of America, and I am the Eastern Pennsylvania district liaison for the SIAM New York-New Jersey-Pennsylvania (NNP) section. I previously served on the board of directors for <a href="http://lgbtmath.org">Spectra, the Association for LGBTQ+ Mathematicians</a>, from 2021-2024.
		I am deeply passionate about promoting diversity and support of LGBTQ+ mathematicians, especially at the the undergraduate and graduate levels.
	
	</p>
	<p>
		I grew up near Seattle, WA and received my B.S. in Applied Mathematics from Seattle University in 2018. I then received my Ph.D. in Applied Mathematics from the University of Delaware in 2023. Outside of school, I enjoy running, cooking, book collecting, scoping out hidden restaurants, playing video games with my partner, and reading in coffee shops.
