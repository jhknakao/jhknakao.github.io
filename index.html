	<br>
	<p>
		I am currently a Ph.D. candidate at the University of Delaware in the Department of Mathematical Sciences. My research focuses on developing efficient, robust, and high-order accurate numerical schemes for solving partial differential equations with a particular emphasis on plasma physics applications. Specific topics include: Eulerian-Lagrangian and semi-Lagrangian methods, low rank tensor methods, and the Fokker-Planck equation.
	</p>
	<p>
		I am deeply passionate about promoting diversity and support of LGBTQ+ mathematicians, especially at the the undergraduate and graduate levels. Since 2021 I have been on the board of directors for Spectra (<a href="http://lgbtmath.org">link here</a>), the Association for LGBTQ+ Mathematicians. I am the chair of the membership committee that oversees visibility campaigns highlighting LGBTQ+ mathematicians, receptions at conferences (e.g., JMM), and brainstorming ways to further connect people in our community. If you would like to volunteer with my committee, please feel free to contact me!
		In addition to my Spectra involvement, I helped form the Queer and Trans Graduate Students Union (QTGSU) at the University of Delaware and have been a board member during the 2021-2022 academic year.
	</p>
	<p>
		I grew up near Seattle, WA and received my B.S. in Applied Mathematics from Seattle University in 2018. Outside of school, I enjoy running, cooking, book collecting, scoping out hidden restaurants, and reading in a good old-fashioned coffee shop.
