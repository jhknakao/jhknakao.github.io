	<br>
	<p>
		I am an Assistant Professor of Mathematics (tenure track) at Swarthmore College in the Department of Mathematics & Statistics. My research focuses on developing efficient and robust algorithms for solving partial differential equations. Recently, I have studied applications of low-rank tensor decompositions and their applications in plasma physics and fluid dynamics.
	</p>
	<p>
		I am deeply passionate about promoting diversity and support of LGBTQ+ mathematicians, especially at the the undergraduate and graduate levels. Since 2021 I have been on the board of directors for Spectra (<a href="http://lgbtmath.org">link here</a>), the Association for LGBTQ+ Mathematicians. I am the chair of the membership committee that oversees visibility campaigns highlighting LGBTQ+ mathematicians, receptions at conferences (e.g., JMM), and brainstorming ways to further connect people in our community. If you would like to volunteer with my committee, please feel free to contact me!
		In addition to my Spectra involvement, I helped form the Queer and Trans Graduate Students Union (QTGSU) at the University of Delaware and was a board member during the 2021-2022 academic year.
	</p>
	<p>
		I grew up near Seattle, WA and received my B.S. in Applied Mathematics from Seattle University in 2018. I then received my Ph.D. in Applied Mathematics from the University of Delaware in 2023. Outside of school, I enjoy running, cooking, book collecting, scoping out hidden restaurants, playing video games with my partner, and reading in coffee shops.
