	<h1>Interested in Doing Research With Me?</h1>
	<font size="4">On this page you will find the qualifications and expectations for participating in undergraduate research with me. Depending on your needs, projects will generally take two or more semesters to complete. That being said, please expect to spend at least one full school year working with me. Projects that I have brewing include: algorithm development, numerical partial differential equations, plasma physics modeling, theoretical estimates of low-rank tensors, data science applications of low-rank tensors. Whether your goal is graduate school, industry, the national laboratories, or something else, hopefully we can find an exciting project for you!</font>
	<br>
	<br>
	<font size="4">If a position is currently open, then feel free to apply! If you have any questions or concerns regarding undergraduate research, please do not hesitate to send me an email.</font>

	<font size="5"><b>Required Qualifications</b></font>
	<ul>
    <li>Minimum 3.5 cumulative GPA.</li>
    <li>Successful completion (grade B+ or higher) of at least one of the following courses: MATH27, MATH28 (preferred over MATH27), MATH43, MATH44.</li>
	</ul>

	<font size="5"><b>Preferred Qualifications (but by no means required)</b></font>
	<ul>
    <li>Moderate fluency in either MATLAB, Julia, or Python. Other languages are acceptable, but we will mostly code in MATLAB and Julia. If you're programming skills aren't up to par, then we can work on them.</li>
    <li>Successful completion of any courses on the following topics: numerical analysis, partial differential equations, real analysis, fluid mechanics, electrodynamics.</li>
    <li>Fluency in LaTeX. I will teach you LaTeX if you do not already know it.</li>
  </ul>
  
  <font size="5"><b>Expectations</b></font>
	<ul>
    <li>4-10 hours of work per week during the school year, depending on the pace at which you're comfortable working. There is no concrete number of hours that is best suited for everyone.</li>
    <li>Weekly meetings.</li>
    <li>Occasional written reports and (short) presentations on your progress and results.</li>
    <li>Perseverance! Research can be quite frustrating at times and will require a lot of perseverance. However, I completely understand this and am very patient as long as I see you working hard. I care a lot more about your effort; the results will come naturally.</li>
