	<font size="4">On this page you will find information about doing undergraduate research with me. Depending on your needs, projects will generally take two or more semesters to complete. That being said, please expect to spend at least one full school year working with me. Projects that I have brewing include: algorithm development, numerical partial differential equations, plasma physics simulations, theoretical estimates of low-rank tensors, data science applications of low-rank tensors. Whether your goal is graduate school, industry, the national laboratories, or something else, hopefully we can find an exciting project for you!</font>
	<br>
	<br>
	<font size="4">If a position is currently open, then feel free to apply! If you have any questions or concerns regarding undergraduate research, please do not hesitate to send me an email.</font>

	<br>
  	<br>
	<font size="5"><b>Required Qualifications</b></font>
	<ul>
    <li>Successful completion of at least one of the following courses: MATH27, MATH28 (preferred over MATH27), MATH43, MATH44.</li>
    <li>Although I do NOT require a minimum GPA, I do expect to see an upward trend in your grades if your first-year grades were/are below B average.</li>
	</ul>

	<font size="5"><b>Preferred Qualifications (but by no means required)</b></font>
	<ul>
    <li>Moderate fluency in either MATLAB, Julia, or Python. Other languages are acceptable, but we will mostly code in MATLAB and Julia. If you're programming skills need improvement, then we can work on them.</li>
    <li>Successful completion of any courses that cover the following topics: numerical analysis, partial differential equations, real analysis.</li>
    <li>Fluency in LaTeX. I will teach you LaTeX if you do not already know it.</li>
  </ul>
  
  <font size="5"><b>Expectations</b></font>
	<ul>
    <li>4-8 hours of work per week during the school year depending on the pace at which you're comfortable working.</li>
    <li>Weekly meetings.</li>
    <li>Occasional written reports and (short) presentations on your progress and results.</li>
    <li>Perseverance! Research can be quite frustrating and slow-moving at times. However, I completely understand this and am very patient so long as I see you working hard. I care much more about your effort and believe that results will then follow naturally.</li>
	</ul>
