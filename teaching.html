	<font size="6"><b>My Teaching Philosophy</b></font>
	<p>
		Over nearly eleven years of teaching (as instructor, teaching assistant, and tutor), I have developed a working philosophy on how to build an inviting and constructive atmosphere for students that I help. At its core, I believe that the key to helping a student reach their greatest potential is to show (com)passion and be well articulated. To be an effective teacher, one must not only be well-versed in a specified topic, but also care about their students' education. For a student, 30 minutes of my time might be more important to them than it is to me. Therefore, although not always feasible, I try my best to accommodate my students.
	</p>
	<p>
		With compassion comes creating a safe learning environment where students feel <i>heard, included,</i> and <i>not alone</i>. These three points of conversation apply in many different ways! They could simply apply to a student feeling lost in the material. Does the student feel their concerns are heard? Does the student feel included in group assignments despite feeling lost? Does the student know that they are (surely) not alone in how they feel? Furthermore, these three points could apply to students from historically marginalized groups (e.g., female, Black, LatinX, LGBTQ+). Do these students feel heard? Do these students feel included? Do these students know they are not alone? I have found that creating a learning atmosphere that embodies this principles helps students feel comfortable being themselves and raising concerns. 
	</p>
	<p>
		My teaching style involves a cycle of "review, demonstrate, practice, clarify". I first review current material; then, I demonstrate an example; after my demonstration, students then attempt a practice problem; any questions or concerns are then clarified, hopefully to the students' satisfaction.
