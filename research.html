	<h1>Research</h1>
	<p>
		My general research area is algorithm development for numerically solving partial differential equations, in particular, hyperbolic equations and kinetic models. Recently, my interests are focused on developing high-order, structure-preserving low-rank methods for solving time-dependent problems. I have also started looking into the data science applications of low-rank tensor decompositions. My previous project involved developing a Eulerian-Lagrangian finite volume method for solving convection-diffusion equations. Other specific areas of interest include: WENO methods, Eulerian-Lagrangian/semi-Lagrangian methods, numerical tensors, and the Fokker-Planck operator. Lecture notes and slides on these topics will be posted under the "Notes and Resources" page as I create them.

		I have also written articles on promoting diversity in the LGBTQ+ mathematics community.
